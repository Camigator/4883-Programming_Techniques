Binary Search Tree Problem 12347

My approach to this problem would to first set up the binary tree given the inputs and roots.
Followed by the lesson we learned last class and in 3013, to organize the list in post post order.

Left child Value
Right Child Value 
Root Node Value

My approach to this problem is understanding that the order of left and right child dont matter. But 
the order of left Children compared to their left root do.

Saying if my left child had one node ( being "1" in this case ) then it can go in any order because
will be the only node. 

Now the right path has 3 idividual nodes ( " 4 , 3, 5 " )
4 must come first as it is the predecessor to the 3 , 5. We understand that 3 and 5 are single nodes that have node
children so, they can be placed after the 4 in any order. 

my way of solving this is to create the original tree, and then compare it ot everycobination after that.
that there are only 24 combination it will be pretty easy to find the permutations of the graph.

We can guess that any list in order will only have one permutation
